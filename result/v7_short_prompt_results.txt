Once upon a time, there was a lonely knight who wandered the land in search of adventure. He had been alone for so long that he had forgotten what it felt like to be part of something bigger than himself. One day, as he rode through a dense forest, he came across an old woman sitting by the side of the road. She looked up at him with kind eyes and said, "Hello there, traveler." The knight dismounted from his horse and approached her cautiously. He had heard stories about witches who could turn people into frogs or worse. But as soon as she spoke to him, he knew that this was no ordinary witch. Her voice was gentle and soothing, like a lullaby on a cold winter's night. She asked the knight if he would join her for some tea and biscuits by the fire. He hesitated at first but eventually agreed. As they sat together in front of the fire, she told him stories about her life as an old woman living alone in the forest. She spoke of how she had once been a beautiful young maiden who fell in love with a handsome prince from another kingdom. But when he left to fight in a war against their enemies, she waited for his return every day by the river where they used to meet. Years passed and still no word came from him. Eventually, she gave up hope of ever seeing her beloved again and decided to live out her days alone in the forest. The knight listened intently as he sipped on his tea and nibbled at his biscuits. He could feel himself becoming more relaxed with each passing moment until finally all tension left his body like a sigh escaping from deep within him. When they finished their snack, she asked if there was anything else that he needed before leaving her company for good. The knight thought about it carefully but couldn't think of any requests beyond what had already been provided so generously by this kind old woman who seemed more interested in listening than talking herself up until now. He thanked her profusely and bid farewell with a warm smile on his face knowing that he would never forget their encounter no matter how long or short it may have lasted.
