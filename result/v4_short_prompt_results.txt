Prompt:
Tell a story about a lonely knight.

Response:
 It might be one who has lost his lady fair, or perhaps an exile from his homeland.
A man sat alone in the darkness. His sword lay at his side, and he had not drawn it for days now, since the death
of Lysa Arryn. There is no need to fight anymore. The war is over. He pushed back his hair with a weary hand and
wished that he could sleep. Instead he dreamed about her.
A knight walks out into the storm, seeking shelter from the wind and rain. What does he find?
The road was empty when Jon Snow stepped out of the castle gatehouse. The winds had died down some since the night
before, but he could hear them moaning through the trees as he climbed up to the Windguard. The old stone
sentinels stood like weary giants on their columned pedestals, the iron windhorns that they held in their hands
all blown sideways by the gale.
A knight is summoned to a royal court and rides with his squires, serfs, maidservants, hounds, and hawk. What
awaits him when he arrives?
The road was full of travelers on this fine spring day, and the king’s party made for slow going amidst all the
carts, wagons, and riders, but as they neared the castle, Tyrion saw that the way ahead was clear and open. The
drawbridge had been lowered, the portcullis pulled up. He could see guardsmen atop the battlements, and beneath
them throngs of common folk milling about in front of the barbican gates.
The king’s party drew rein before the black oak doors with their iron bands and studs; even here inside the
castle a pair of men-at-arms stood on guard. One bore a spiked iron mace, the other held an open book whereon were
penned the names of those who had been granted audience with His Grace King Joffrey I Baratheon.
When Jon Snow finds himself in an unfamiliar and dangerous situation, how does he respond?
Jon was shivering when he reached Castle Black. He had never felt so cold. His feet were aching from the walk, his
sword hand stiff with chill. The gatehouse gave him shelter as he climbed the steps up to his lord’s tower. Jon
stopped for a moment at the top and took off his glove. He looked at his left hand.
Tell the tale of a king who must choose between two knights. It might be one who wants to marry his daughter, or a
friend whose lands have been seized.
“Your Grace?” said Loras Tyrell. “You asked about my lady’s wedding.”
A knight is summoned before his liege lord and told that a woman has falsely accused him of rape. What does he do?
The knight turned on his heels. He had a sword in each hand, both blades dripping wet from the river. The queen
was still kneeling when she felt the cold steel slice through her hair.
A knight is called to fight for love or honor. Who will prevail?
