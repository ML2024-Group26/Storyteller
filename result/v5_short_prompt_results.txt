Prompt:
Tell a story about a lonely knight.

Response:
 The protagonist’s only companion is an ungrateful horse.
You can use the following elements to write your tale:
A sense of longing and solitude
A noble creature struggling with its own nature
A journey through desolate lands
An unexpected encounter
The knight rides through a vast plain under a cold, gray sky. The wind blows incessantly, stinging his face like
needles. He’s been riding for days without seeing any living thing but the birds that occasionally soar above
him. His clothes are torn and filthy, as if they’ve never been washed; the dust that covers them has turned into
mud with each new rain.
He’s hungry too. The food he brought along is almost gone, so now he depends on whatever game he can hunt in this
vast wilderness. But it’s difficult to find anything edible here…
The knight has long since given up hope of finding anyone who might be able to help him out of his predicament. He
knows that he must continue riding alone until something happens – either some animal or a human being will
appear on the horizon and offer assistance.
You are a lonely knight, traveling through desolate lands with only your horse for company. You have been riding
for days without seeing any living thing but birds soaring above you. The wind blows incessantly, stinging your
face like needles; your clothes are torn and filthy, as if they’ve never been washed. And now that the food you
brought along is almost gone, you depend on whatever game you can hunt in this vast wilderness.
You don’t know where you’re going or what lies ahead of you – only that somehow it’s time to move forward
again. Sooner or later something will happen; either some animal or a human being will appear on the horizon and
offer assistance.
What else would be helpful for writing your story?
Think about the following:
How can we describe this character’s loneliness and isolation? What makes him so alone in his travels?
Why does he ride through such desolate lands? Where is he going, and what does he hope to find there?
The rider stopped at an inn called The Three Crowns. It was a large building with many chimneys and windows
covered by wooden shutters; its doors were made of thick oak boards reinforced by iron bands.
“It’s late,” said the horseman as he dismounted. “I will stay here tonight.”
“The last meal is served on the ground floor,” answered one of the stableboys, who was busy grooming some
horses. “If you want to eat, go down now; otherwise we won’t be able to provide you with anything else until
morning!”
The rider nodded and walked inside through a heavy wooden door that creaked loudly under his weight.
“I would like a bowl of porridge,” he said at the bar. The tavern keeper looked at him strangely but quickly put
an earthenware pot on fire and poured some milk into it. Then she brought over another pot full of oatmeal –
thick, yellowish liquid with lumps floating in it; they had been boiled too long before being served.
“It’s not very appetizing,” thought the rider while eating his supper. Nevertheless, he finished everything
quickly because he was hungry and didn’t want to waste time waiting for more food.
Afterwards he sat down on a bench next to one of the stoves that stood against all four walls; it was burning
brightly but gave off no heat since there were no fires inside yet (it must have been almost midnight). He stared
into space, thinking about nothing in particular. Then suddenly someone knocked on his shoulder from behind.
“Sir!” said a voice full of respect and awe at once. “The innkeeper asks that you follow her immediately! She
has something important to tell you!”
The rider turned around slowly; his eyes were half closed due to fatigue or maybe because he was getting used to
darkness again after so many hours spent under the open sky…
“I’m sorry,” said one of them in a low voice. “We didn’t mean to disturb your rest.”
“It’s all right,” replied the rider indifferently and turned away from them without saying anything else.
The next morning, he woke up early enough but still felt tired – as if he hadn’t slept at all last night…
The knight had only one companion: an ungrateful horse. The animal didn’t seem to like him much either, so the
rider decided not to take it into consideration when making decisions about where they should go next.
He was riding towards a small village where some farmers lived; perhaps someone would be willing to sell grain or
vegetables there? He also thought that if he found anyone who could help him out of his predicament by offering
food or money, then this person must have been born under a lucky star because otherwise how else could they
survive so long without dying…
The weather was still bad: foggy and gloomy as ever; but at least there wasn’t any rain yet!
A lone knight riding through desolate lands with only an ungrateful horse for company – that’s what the story is
about. The protagonist has been traveling for a long time now, but he doesn’t know where he is going or what lies
ahead of him.
He knows nothing except his duty and the fact that sooner or later something will happen; either some animal or
human being will appear on the horizon and offer assistance…
The rider’s horse was restless. It snorted, raised its tail and began to move forward without being commanded by
anyone: it wanted to leave this place as soon as possible.
“Stop!” said the knight angrily. “It’s too late for you now; we have to wait until morning.”
He dismounted from his saddle but didn’t take off the bridle because he knew that if they stayed there all night
without feeding themselves, then tomorrow they would be hungry again – and this time he wouldn’t find any food
anywhere near by…
The sun was already rising above the horizon when our hero woke up. It shone brightly on one side of his face; but
where did it come from? He didn’t remember sleeping with anything except his cloak wrapped around him tightly
like a blanket…
He sat up slowly and looked outside through an open window – nothing but gray clouds covered everything, as usual…
 So this weather will last for several days yet!
The knight got dressed quickly; he put on all his belongings again (except weapons) because there was no point in
leaving them here: they had already been stolen once before! He grabbed the reins of his horse and walked towards
The Three Crowns inn where it seemed that people were still sleeping inside…
“Please, sir,” said one of those sitting at the table. “Come over here!”
The knight slowly approached them but didn’t take a seat on any chair because he knew they wouldn’t let him stay
there until morning – especially if someone ordered something to drink for themselves or others (it was common
practice among travelers who wanted to save money).
