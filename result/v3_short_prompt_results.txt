Prompt:
Tell a story about a lonely knight.

Response:
 The story must begin by describing the castle in the distance, and then lead to the encounter with the knight.
In 1830, when the author of the story was 27 years old, the poet Gogol had already made his name through
publications of several novels that would later become classics. He became famous thanks to "Evenings on a farm
near Dikanka", “Taras Bulba” and other works. However, the success did not change the life of the writer - he
was still unhappy in love.
After the failure with his first wife Gogol went mad, and decided that he should not be a writer but to become a
priest and then he would have a chance to get rid of feelings for one girl. So he moved to Rome, where he lived in
a monastery. The whole life was spent by Gogol as if it were a lie - he invented his family history, created
fictional characters instead of real people from his biography.
He also wrote letters to a young woman who once had become the object of his love. It is assumed that it was her
portrait served as inspiration for the image of Natalya Vyrubova in "The Knight with an iron mask".

Gogol left Italy after three years, and then moved back to St. Petersburg - in order to be closer to his mother
and sister. But soon he was again forced to leave town.
Once the writer was on a train at night when suddenly there was heard a loud noise from outside and the car began
to shake violently. The driver had lost control of the carriage and it went off the rails. Passengers rushed out,
but Gogol, still sitting in his seat, was looking for the reason why the accident happened.
"I do not know what I saw, but there were people on horseback," he wrote in his diary. "They seemed to have been
riding at night for a long time and did not see us - we were standing out from the surrounding darkness with our
bright lights. And then, as soon as they noticed the light, they immediately jumped away ... I do not know what
happened to them."
This incident Gogol associated in his imagination with the appearance of the Knight in black armor.
In "The Knight in a steel helmet" the author skillfully combined historical facts and legends, creating a
mysterious image of a knight in a steel mask. The idea that the character was inspired by the historical figure is
not new - there are many such theories about the origin of the story.
The main source for this hypothesis is a chronicle which reports on how one night in 1577 two men on horseback
passed through St. Petersburg, and then disappeared. There were rumors among the townsfolk that they had been
pursued by the Black Knight, whose mission was to take over the city and kill the Tsar.
There are also legends about a man named Egor Ivanov who for several years served as a guard at an estate near
Lake Ladoga where a black knight lived in solitude. One day, a group of peasants armed with sticks came to the
house - they wanted to find out whether there were any ghosts or other evil spirits living on the estate.
When they saw the knight and his black horse, their courage was immediately gone - they fled from the place.
However, not only did Ivanov stay there but also began to serve the Black Knight as a squire and then as a page.
The legend has been passed down in the local folklore for many years. It is believed that Egor died near Lake
Ladoga.
The story "Knight with an iron mask" was first published on December 16, 1835, by Theodor Reuss, who had known
Gogol since his childhood. In the spring of 1936 it appeared in a magazine "Northern Flowers", and after that it
became a classic - one of the best works of the Russian writer.
It is noteworthy that it was a German who brought to light this story - as a rule, the translation from Russian
into German had an opposite effect: the original remained unknown. Thus, for many years "The Knight in iron mask"
has become the most popular work of Gogol's stories for the German-speaking audience.
As a result, it is difficult today to find its English or French translation - as they are not very successful.
And yet, this story is one of the best works by Nikolai Gogol.
The hero of the story and his horse seemed like a living shadow; they rode slowly, at a lazy pace, but with great
speed. And suddenly they disappeared from the horizon!
After a while, the knight appeared again in the distance. He was riding even faster than before and approached the
rider. In an instant he took him into his arms and galloped away into the darkness.
The next morning Gogol found a note on the table, which read:
"Dear Sir,
I ask you to be calm about yesterday's events - I apologize for my action. Do not forget that we have all met by
chance in this world, but it is better to have some contact between us and our existence.
Please do not think of me as a stranger who suddenly appeared from nowhere and vanished just as quickly: remember
that fate has brought you together with me.
I am very close to the place where I live. I have my home on the shore of the sea, and there is a forest around
it. The road leads through this forest into the heart of Russia. In order for us not to meet accidentally again -
please refrain from visiting my estate for three years.
Yours faithfully,
The Knight in an iron mask."

A few days later Gogol was leaving St. Petersburg, and soon he met a strange knight on the road. The man
approached him and asked:
"Are you going to Moscow?"
"No," said the writer, "I am going to my hometown - I will travel around the city."
The stranger looked at him for a long time. Then he took off his helmet and mask.
Gogol saw a young girl with beautiful eyes - the knight was Natalya Vyrubova.
The story of Gogol's encounter with Natalia is well known in Russia, but it is very little information about their
relationship.
