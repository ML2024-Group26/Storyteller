Prompt:
Write a short story about a young blacksmith who forges a magical sword. The sword has the power to choose its wielder, and its choice sets the blacksmith on a quest to save their kingdom. The story should have a conclusive and satisfying ending

Response:
The blacksmith stirred. “No,” he said softly, “you need not do that.” He rose from his bench and stepped into
the sunlight. “I shall make you a sword, but it will be a very different sort of blade.”
“Very well,” said Dwalin. “What kind?”
“A very great weapon,” said the blacksmith.
Dwalin nodded. “Aye, I could have guessed that myself.”
The dwarf looked at his friend as they walked toward the forest edge together. “Well, what is this sword to be
like? You’ve not said yet.”
“Ah!” said Balin, and chuckled. “It is a blade that has been made in secret by two master craftsmen, forged
with a special strength and lightness of its own. No smiths could have worked upon it except for Thorin
Oakenshield and Dwalin the Gray.” He smiled at his friend. “And no sword has ever had such power put into it. It
is called Glamdring.”
“I’ll wager it will be a sharp weapon,” said Dwalin, “and mayhap it will not break so easily as that other
one.”
“That is true, my friend,” said Balin.
They walked on in silence for a while. Then Balin spoke again. “Now we must seek out the sword called Orcrist. It
should be in some place of safety and honour. I would say, by the look of it, that it is kept among the treasures
of Thorin’s Company.”
“Yes,” said Dwalin.
