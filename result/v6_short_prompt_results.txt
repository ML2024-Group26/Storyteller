Prompt:
Tell a story about a lonely knight.

Response:
 It can be based in medieval times, or you could write something more modern. A tale of adventure with plenty of
magic and mystery would work well.hf.co/Group-26/storyteller_v6:Q8_0
The old man's eyes glittered with amusement. “And what else will you need? A dragon perhaps?”
Ciri laughed. “A dragon wouldn’t help here. I’m looking for a knight in armour to fight an evil sorcerer.”
“What is this, Ciri? Do you really think your tale is so great?” asked Yennefer, who was sitting on the other
side of the fire and listening with interest.
“Well,” she began slowly. “I have to get him out of his castle first…”
“A knight in a castle? Aha! That’s why you wanted an archer and not a dragon!”
“Ha ha! That’s very funny, Ciri. But what about your sorcerer?”
“Oh… He has a horse.”
“And that’ll be all, will it?” said Dandelion. “A knight in armour, fighting with a sword, against a sorcerer,
riding on his horse?”
“That would make a great tale!” exclaimed Yennefer, clapping her hands together.
“I don’t think so,” the archer replied sourly. “I’m thinking of something a little more modest.”
“Modest? I don’t believe you! You must be thinking about something much grander! A dragon, at least!”
“No dragons,” said Ciri. “There will only be one knight in armour, and he’ll fight with a sword and a lance…”

“And against whom?” asked the old man.
“The sorcerer.”
“A sorcerer? I see… But who would that be? The Evil Sorcerer?”
Ciri hesitated. And then she said: “Yes!”
“Hmm,” sighed the old man, looking into his mug of mead. “I don’t think your knight in armour will find it
easy to kill an evil sorcerer.”
“Well, I hope he does manage to do it… And if he doesn’t? Then what?”
Then what indeed?
Geralt slowly walked down a cobbled street lined with high walls and closed doors. The sun had set long ago, but
the sky above the wall of the castle was still bright with its purple reflections.
He suddenly felt thirsty and decided to take the opportunity to quench his thirst before he entered into the
presence of the Lord of Castle Fingers. He went down an alley leading to the outer courtyard, and then climbed up
a spiral staircase in the tower where he had left the mare.
Geralt found himself at a door with two massive wooden rings attached to it. The horse was standing in her stall.
He walked over to her, stroked her silky coat and gently lifted the ring on the left side.
“Why didn’t you get back earlier?”
He turned around sharply. Geralt had forgotten about the stable-boy who’d been talking to him when he brought the
mare into the castle.
“I’m sorry,” he said curtly. “I was delayed… Do you know if my lord has come in yet from hunting?”
“No, milord.”
Geralt took a deep breath. He should have realised that nobody would tell him the truth straight away. But it was
not only that.
“You can take this horse to her stall,” he said softly, giving him the mare’s halter and leading her along the
corridor. “I’ll be back later.” The boy led his horse to a stall with a door which had two rings, like the one
through which Geralt had entered the tower. The witcher went down the stairs quickly.
He passed the stable and went out into the courtyard. To his left was an exit gate. He crossed over towards it.
There were four guards standing next to it, all in full armour, and with spears in their hands. A few paces from
them stood two servants holding torches.
“Milord,” one of the soldiers said respectfully. “I have been informed that you are here by order of the Lady
of Castle Fingers.”
“I’ve come for my lord,” Geralt replied curtly.
The guard stepped back and opened the gate, then led him over to the stables where several horses were standing in
their stalls. Two men, also wearing armour, were cleaning them.
“Milord?”
“Yes? What is it, Dandelion?”
“The lady would like us to have lunch.”
“I can’t. I need to see my lord.”
“Then perhaps later,” said the knight with an expressionless face and a faint smile on his lips.
“You may go now, Dandelion.” The knight turned away to continue talking to the servant who was mucking out one
of the stalls. Geralt walked up to the door leading into the castle.
The guard opened it for him respectfully. “Welcome, milord.”
Geralt went through a large hall decorated with carved stags. He entered another room which had a stone floor. It
led on to an enormous vaulted corridor with benches and chairs in front of each of the wooden doors. In the
alcoves between the pillars there were two armed guards and several servants.
The witcher walked slowly, looking at the closed doors, listening for voices from behind them. He didn’t hear
any. On one of the benches a young girl was sitting under an embroidered cloth. She had long fair hair and big
blue eyes. She looked up as he passed by, but quickly lowered her head. Geralt felt something in his chest
tighten. He moved on.
He walked slowly along the corridor, looking at each door in turn, but there were no signs of life behind any of
them. He thought about knocking and asking for permission to enter, but decided against it. It would be better if
he found out first whether Dandelion was actually here or not.
Geralt heard voices from around a corner. He quickened his pace slightly, rounded the bend in the corridor and
looked into one more room. The witcher stopped abruptly.
He saw three people: the sorcerer, two guards dressed as servants, who were standing behind him with halberds
slung over their shoulders, and Dandelion, who was kneeling beside the fireplace.
A long line of black blood slowly dripped down the side of his face and onto his blue velvet doublet. Geralt’s
hands clenched into fists at his sides. He walked towards them stiffly and angrily. The sorcerer raised his head
as he neared him, but looked back quickly when Geralt approached.
Geralt stopped in front of him, looking down on the short man with contempt and anger. Then he looked around at
the guards and Dandelion who was still kneeling with his head bowed. He stepped forward and kicked the sorcerer
under the chin. The short man fell backwards onto his backside, but instantly regained his feet.
“What are you doing here? Get out!” he yelled.
“I didn’t come to see you,” said Geralt coldly. “I came for my friend.”
“Well, well! Have a look at your friend and leave!”
Geralt looked down at Dandelion who was sitting on the floor, with his head bowed in shame. The witcher could only
just hear the sound of his heavy breathing.
“Dandelion…” he said softly.
“It’s nothing, Geralt,” Dandelion replied between clenched teeth. “Please go.”
The knight shook his head and stepped forward to help him to his feet.
He saw red stains on the ground beside him and realised that one of his boots was covered in blood. He looked down
at it for a moment in silence. Then he bent down again and held out his hands to Dandelion, who had fallen into
unconsciousness.
“I will not allow this!”
“You have no choice, sir.”
The witcher felt the point of the blade against his neck. Geralt did not move. He was only thinking about how best
to use his hands to catch the sorcerer when he lunged forward again with a dagger.
“Do as I say or you will die,” the sorcerer said calmly.
Geralt could feel Dandelion’s warm blood dripping slowly down onto his neck and shoulder from beneath his left
boot. The witcher closed his eyes tightly for a moment, then opened them again. He looked into the sorcerer’s
dark, cold eyes and clenched his jaw tightly as the point of the blade pressed harder against his throat.
He heard two men walking along the corridor towards him.
“Please,” said the sorcerer in a slightly more friendly tone. “I don’t want anyone to get hurt.”
The witcher did not move. He felt the pressure of the blade increase slightly, but still he remained motionless.
The footsteps grew louder and closer as they neared them.
“Sir!”
Geralt closed his eyes for a second time and tried to focus on a single point in space. Then he opened his eyes
again quickly when he heard voices coming from behind him.
He stood with his hands raised, keeping his palms open so that the sorcerer could see clearly there were no
weapons or other objects hidden beneath them.
“Sir?”
“It’s all right, Triss.”
“I’m sorry, Your Lordship,” said Geralt in a low voice. “I thought it would be better to come and save your
friend from you, if I may say so.”
“I had to take precautions,” the sorcerer replied coldly. He turned around slowly, his gaze sweeping over the
witcher’s body as though he was checking him for weapons or other means of defence.
Geralt stood still with his arms raised above his head and remained silent in response to the sorcerer’s
scrutiny.
“Sir?”
“Everything is all right now,” said the sorcerer, returning his dagger to its sheath. He straightened up and
looked around at Triss Merigold.
Triss, who was standing beside him with her eyes downcast, did not look at him. She just stood there motionless in
silence for a long time. Then she slowly raised her head and stepped forward towards Geralt.
“Geralt…”
The witcher moved aside as Triss Merigold embraced Dandelion and lifted him up gently into her arms. He stood
silently to one side, looking on without saying anything as the sorcerer walked away with his guards.
“Dandelion,” said Triss Merigold softly.
She set him down carefully onto a chair beside the fireplace. Geralt looked around for some water, but saw there
was no jug or any other container close by. He crouched down beside Dandelion who was lying motionless on the
floor and pressed his hand to his friend’s neck in search of his pulse.
He found it after a while. It throbbed under Geralt’s fingers, slow but regular.
Dandelion was breathing heavily again. The witcher could hear every one of his breaths clearly as they slowly
filled and emptied his lungs. He looked around at Triss Merigold who was staring intently at him with wide-open
eyes. She was holding Dandelion tightly in her arms, rocking him gently.
“Triss…” Geralt began.
“No,” she said coldly. “Don’t say anything.”
“I will be back shortly,” he continued as if she had not spoken. He got up and walked away quickly towards the
corridor from where they had come, Triss Merigold calling after him anxiously:
